# Jala Design - Test Project

---

Thanks again for the opportunity to interview for Jala! So to start
 I started off with just a HTML5 template and CSS. I then decided that I'll give Bootstrap a go as it may be easier to make the static website more web responsive.

 I've worked with Bootstrap but just to style an already finished project. My experience using it this time for layouts/CSS was a bit of a learning curve, I've LEARNED MANY things (mainly Bootstrap) just from this project and in all honesty I may have some not-so-best-practice on my code, I rushed a lot of it and am a tad disappointed as I wish I added JavaScript with a simple backend (planning to do a form with the 'GET STARTED' button).

I would love and appreciate your feedback!
